Hey there!

I've just started learning programming, but it looks pretty cool. I'm a little bit overwhelmed by how many paths I can choose, but for now I will stick to JS and Python.
I'm from Witcher's maker country, so it's only natural that I love RPG and slavic demonology.
One day I wish to visit South Korea (big fan of korean poculture here), meet Natalie Portman and live in Iceland in old age (wild horses and black, lonesome beaches are amazing views).
